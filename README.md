# Game called "Guess My Number"
This is the first game I have created in javascript utilizing the basic principles of the DOM
# Aim of the game
The aim of the game to find the hidden number as soon as is possible, based on the instructions given to him.
# How to play?
Initially, the player enters a number from 1 to 20. If the number he gives matches the hidden number, then he wins the game with the maximum score (20).
If the number he gave is not the same as the hidden one then he continues to enter numbers until he succeeds, following the instructions given to him.
In each failed attempt to find the number, the score decreases by one(The game starts with a maximum score of 20).
After repeated failed attempts, if the score becomes 0, then the player loses and the game is over.
